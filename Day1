*To Interact with Operating System there is only one way we have to Run the program
*program file == command
*to store data in hard drive put data into file.
*progrm runs on the main memory (RAM) then we can interact with program.
*there are 4 ways to install linux or to use linux
     1.Bare Metal
     2.cloud computing 
          a.azure
	  b.AWS
     3.Virtualization
          a.vmware
	  b.oracle vmbox
     4.Containerization
          a.docker
	  b.kubernetes
	  c.openshift
*oracle vmbox :- the one who can store multiple O.S 

*human brain-->tolearn something -->requires iteration.

*login--> admin account/root user -->unlimited power
          non root account --> limited power


* we can interact with O.S with	  1. GUI
                                  2. CLI
				  3.WEB UI --> COCKPIT
	We will more focus on CLI (command line interface) to interact with OS.

*installed O.S redhat RHEL9 DVD ISO on Oracle vm box.
*learned some basic stuff about how to use it.
